            Hej! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Marcus and I love designing apps and websites that look
            and feel great. I live in Sweden.

            When I was a kid, I was blown away by automatic doors. They looked
            so futuristic being made of glass, and they opened like magic as I
            walked up to them! Since then, Iâ€™ve gotten over the doors, but Iâ€™m
            still fascinated by all kinds of tech. When I got my first Android
            phone, I spent lots of time customising it with wallpapers, icon
            packs and apps. Making my phone look and work however I wanted was
            an unexpected creative outlet. Today, my mind has ended up somewhere
            between tech and design.

            I design mainly for the web and I have experience with front-end web
            development using tools like Vue, React and SCSS. When designing and
            building websites, I strive to make them useful, accessible and
            enjoyable to use.

            When free and not designing or coding, I like following the latest
            in tech news and tinkering with my devices. I also very much enjoy
            music (both listening and creating) and playing video games with
            friends.
